      <h2>Preparation for the annual ball</h2>
      <p>
        The annual ball is the most prestigious of the guild’s celebrations and requires carefull preparation.
        With these tips, even the inexperienced guest can get started and enjoy the evening to the fullest.
        <br />
        At the annual ball, the behaviour is excellent and considerate of others.
        Good manners and courtesy go a long way, and in difficult situations you can look to your neighbour for guidance.
        <br />
        The sign of a successful party is that you and everyone else are having fun and feeling safe.
      </p>
      <section id="avec">
        <h3>Avec</h3>
        <p>
          You can also choose an avec from outside the guild, and you may already have one at home or the immediate vicinity of your home.
          However, if choosing an avec is not this trivial, you can ask other guild members without dates to be your avec.
          Of course, it is perfectly fine to attend the party without a designated avec.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Dress code</h3>
        <p>
          Men usually dress in a white tie (tailcoat) or a dark suit.
          If you plan to attend more annual balls in the future, you might want to consider buying your own white tie.
          A dark suit is also fine.
          <br />
          Women usually opt for a full-length evening gown.
          The style and colour of the dress can be chosen according to your own preference,
          but the full-white one should be left for weddings.
          <br />
          It’s not a bad thing to wear the same outfit more than once,
          and by changing accessories and embellishments you can get away with one basic dress/suit for a long time.
          You can also rent a white tie or a evening gown.
          Usually, costume hire companies rent and sell the same outfits,
          so you can try several options by popping into one shop.
          At the same time, you can get professional advice on what suits you best and the prices of the different options.
          It’s also worth asking older guild members for tips on buying a dress/suit!

        <h3>Academic medals and badges</h3>
        <p>
          Potential academic medals will be placed on the left chest of the outfit.
          If you have not (yet) accumulated any medals,
          you can buy the guild’s bronze membership badge for 15€.
          You can ask the board members for these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The student Union ribbon is available at the AYY service point in Otaniemi for a nominal price of a couple of euros.
          The ribbon is to be worn from the right shoulder to the left hip.
          Women can also
          <a href="https://www.ayy.fi/en/insignia-used-by-aalto-students/making-a-bow-out-of-the-student-union-sash" target="_blank">
          fold the ribbon into a rosette on the chest
          </a> if the dress is open at the shoulders.
          The rosette is worn on the right side of the dress.
