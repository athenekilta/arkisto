        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          We welcome you to Infoähky on 2nd of December 2022 to celebrate the 23-year-old Information Networks guild Athene.
          <br />
          <br />
          The celebration starts with a cocktail event at 4 pm in the CS-building (Konemiehentie 2, Espoo).
          After the cocktail event there are buses to take us to the academic table party,
          which takes place in the Round Hall of Hotel Kalastajatorppa (Kalastajatorpantie 1), from 5:45 pm onwards.
          After the academic table party, the night continues at a secret afterparty location X, where we are taken by buses from Kalastajatorppa.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next morning guests have a chance to relax at Purkusessio, which is held in Otaniemi, at Rantasauna (Vastaranta 1) from 12 pm onwards.
          <br />
          <br />
          The price of the event is 90€ for students and 110€ for others. In addition, the sillis costs 10€.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a href="https://athene.fi/en/principles/">The common principles of Athene</a>

      <h2>Preparation for the annual ball</h2>
      <p>
        The annual ball is the most prestigious of the guild’s celebrations and requires carefull preparation.
        With these tips, even the inexperienced guest can get started and enjoy the evening to the fullest.
        <br /><br />
        At the annual ball, the behaviour is excellent and considerate of others.
        Good manners and courtesy go a long way, and in difficult situations you can look to your neighbour for guidance.
        The sign of a successful party is that you and everyone is having fun and feeling safe.
        <br /><br />
        This year climbing on chairs will not be allowed in the academic table party.
      </p>
      <section id="avec" class="section-margin">
        <h3>Avec</h3>
        <p>
          You can also choose an avec from outside the guild, and you may already have one at home or the immediate vicinity of your home.
          However, if choosing an avec is not this trivial, you can ask other guild members without dates to be your avec.
          Of course, it is perfectly fine to attend the party without a designated avec.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section-margin">
        <h3>Dress code</h3>
        <p>
          Guests usually wear a full-length evening gown, a white tie (tailcoat) or a dark suit to the annual ball.
          The style and colour of the dress can be chosen according to your own preference,
          but the full-white one should be left for weddings.
          While it is advisable to wear formal attire, the most important thing is to dress up in a way that feels good to you.
          <br/><br />
          If you plan to attend more annual balls in the future, you might want to consider buying your own white tie.
          A dark suit is also fine.
          <br /><br />
          It’s not a bad thing to wear the same outfit more than once,
          and by changing accessories and embellishments you can get away with one basic dress/suit for a long time.
          You can also rent a white tie or an evening gown.
          Usually, costume hire companies rent and sell the same outfits,
          so you can try several options by popping into a shop.
          At the same time, you can get professional advice on what suits you best and the prices of the different options.
          It’s also worth asking older guild members for tips on buying a dress/suit!

        <h3>Academic medals and badges</h3>
        <p>
          Potential academic medals will be placed on the left chest of the outfit.
          If you have not (yet) accumulated any medals,
          you can buy the guild’s bronze membership badge for 18€.
          You can ask the board members for these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The student Union ribbon is available at the AYY service point in Otaniemi for a nominal price of a couple of euros.
          The ribbon is to be worn from the right shoulder to the left hip.
          Women can also
          <a href="https://www.ayy.fi/en/insignia-used-by-aalto-students/making-a-bow-out-of-the-student-union-sash" target="_blank">
          fold the ribbon into a rosette on the chest
          </a> if the dress is open at the shoulders.
          The rosette is worn on the right side of the dress.
