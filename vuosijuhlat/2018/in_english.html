      <h1> Infoähky in English</h1>
      <p>Infoähky is the grand annual ball of the Information Networks guild Athene. This year we are celebrating the 19-year-old
        Athene on Friday 16th of November.</p>
      <p>The festivities begin with a cocktail party at the CS-building. After enjoying a delightful cocktail hour busses
        will take us to the intimate gala dinner held at Restaurant Sipuli's Talvipuutarha. To finish the night with a bang the rambunctious
        afterparty will be held at a secret location. On the following day the party goes on with the sillis-party Purkusessio
        at the Rantasauna in Otaniemi. </p>

      <h2>Etiquette</h2>
      <p>The grand annual ball is the most prestigious party in the guild has and calls upon careful preparation. A gentleman's
        behaviour is vital in creating the festive atmosphere. Good manners and grace are expected and if you are not sure
        how to handle the situation you can always learn from your neighbours.</p>
      <p>The dresscode for men is either a dress suit/tailcoat or a dark suit. For women the event is a perfect excuse to
        pamper themselves as the dresscode is a full-length evening gown. The style and colour is up to your own taste
        but let’s leave the full white gowns to the weddings. </p>
      <p>The getting ready to the annual ball can get very expensive. The festivities itself will be more cheaper as the attendance
        fee(80 e) covers everything from the gala dinner, transportation and even the cloakrooms. Instead it is recommendable
        to have cash for additional drinks and a cab if you wish to spend the night somewhere else than Otaniemi.</p>
      <h2>International students</h2>
      <p>As International students, you have the possibility to help with arranging the festivities with the freshmen, attend
        the whole festivities or only attend the after party. </p>
      <p>The freshmen of Athene are traditionally working in different roles in the annual ball festivities. Helping in creating
        this magical event is not only fun but also very exciting. The roles differ from serving punch at the cocktail
        party, serving food and drinks in the after party. While helping you can easily get new friends of the guild members
        and also enjoy the parties especially the after party (if your not working there). Venla will inform you more
        about helping with the arrangements. </p>
      <p>The attendance fee to the whole annual ball festivities (including cocktail-party, Gala Dinner, after party) is 80
        euros for students, but if this feels like too much for you it is possible to only to attend the afterparty which
        costs 5 euros. If you wish to attend the whole festivities(cocktail party, gala dinner, afterparty, sillis) contact
        Venla, she will help you with the arrangements and registration.</p>
