        <h1> Infoähky in English</h1>
        <p>Infoähky is the grand annual ball of the Information Networks guild Athene. This year we are celebrating the 18-year-old
          Athene on Friday 17th of November.</p>
        <p>The festivities begin with a cocktail party at the CS-building. After enjoying a delightful cocktail hour busses
          will take us to the intimate gala dinner held at Meripaviljonki. To finish the night with a bang the rambunctious
          afterparty will be held at a secret location. On the following day the party goes on with the sillis-party Purkusessio
          at the Rantasauna in Otaniemi. </p>

        <h2>Saturday 18.11.2017</h2>
        <p><strong>12.00</strong> Purkusessio, Rantasauna, Vastaranta 1</p>
        <h2>Etiquette</h2>
        <p>The grand annual ball is the most prestigious party in the guild has and calls upon careful preparation. A gentleman's
          behaviour is vital in creating the festive atmosphere. Good manners and grace are expected and if you are not sure
          how to handle the situation you can always learn from your neighbours.</p>
        <p>The dresscode for men is either a dress suit/tailcoat or a dark suit. For women the event is a perfect excuse to
          pamper themselves as the dresscode is a full-length evening gown. The style and colour is up to your own taste
          but let’s leave the full white gowns to the weddings. </p>
        <p>The getting ready to the annual ball can get very expensive. The festivities itself will be more cheaper as the attendance
          fee(80 e) covers everything from the gala dinner, transportation and even the cloakrooms. Instead it is recommendable
          to have cash for additional drinks and a cab if you wish to spend the night somewhere else than Otaniemi.</p>
        <h2>International students</h2>
        <p>As International students, you have the possibility to help with arranging the festivities with the freshmen, attend
          the whole festivities or only attend the after party. </p>
        <p>The freshmen of Athene are traditionally working in different roles in the annual ball festivities. Helping in creating
          this magical event is not only fun but also very exciting. The roles differ from serving punch at the cocktail
          party, serving food and drinks in the after party. While helping you can easily get new friends of the guild members
          and also enjoy the parties especially the after party (if your not working there). George will inform you more
          about helping with the arrangements. </p>
        <p>The attendance fee to the whole annual ball festivities (including cocktail-party, Gala Dinner, after party) is 80
          euros for students, but if this feels like too much for you it is possible to only to attend the afterparty which
          costs 5 euros. If you wish to attend the whole festivities(cocktail party, gala dinner, afterparty, sillis) contact
          George, he will help you with the arrangements and registration.</p>
